# Error Handling Protocol

## General Guidelines
1. All errors must be logged with appropriate severity levels
2. Error messages must be descriptive and actionable
3. Stack traces should be preserved where possible
4. Errors must be categorized by type and severity

## Error Categories
- VALIDATION_ERROR: Input validation failures
- RUNTIME_ERROR: Runtime execution failures
- SYSTEM_ERROR: System-level failures
- EXTERNAL_ERROR: External service/dependency failures

## Logging Levels
- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
- INFO: General operational information
- WARNING: Potentially harmful situations
- ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue
- CRITICAL: Critical errors that may lead to application termination

## Error Recording Protocol
1. All errors must be recorded in the historical_tracking.csv
2. Critical errors must trigger immediate notifications
3. Error patterns should be analyzed weekly
